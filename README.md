Basic uses of this tool ans techniques:
This code defines a GUI tool for creating a combination of video clips from a selected input folder. The tool is built using the tkinter library and imports two functions from the combo_creator module.

The os module is imported at the beginning of the code, but it is not used in this particular script.

The ComboWindow class is defined with several methods. The __init__ method initializes the GUI window with labels, text boxes, buttons, and a progress bar. The browse_folder method opens a file dialog window for selecting the input folder. The set_combo_progress method sets the value of the progress bar. The set_combo_status_tip_text method displays a message box with a status text. The call_combo method retrieves the input folder and output file name from the GUI components and calls the create_combo function from the combo_creator module.

The main function creates an instance of the ComboWindow class and starts the GUI event loop using the mainloop() method of the Tk class.

Overall, this code demonstrates how to use the tkinter library to build a simple GUI tool for video clip combination.
